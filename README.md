HematoVision is a deep learning-based system designed to classify different types of blood cells using transfer learning. The goal of this project is to aid in the detection and diagnosis of blood-related diseases by automating the identification of cell types from microscopic images.
Objectives:
Build a blood cell classification model using transfer learning.

Train and evaluate the model using a labeled image dataset.

Develop a user-friendly interface to upload and classify images.

Help support early diagnosis of hematological disorders.
